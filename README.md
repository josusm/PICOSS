# PICOSS
> A Python Interface for the Classification of Seismic Signals.

PICOSS is a Python GUI designed as a modular data-curator platform for volcano-seismic data analysis. Detection, 
segmentation and classification. With exportability and standardization at its core, users can select automatic 
or manual workflows to annotate seismic data from the suite of included tools. 

Originally, PICOSS was designed for the purposes of seismicity research as a collaboration between University of Granada 
(UGR) and University of Liverpool (UoL). However, the system can be used within a wide range of geophysical applications.

## Installation

* PICOSS works in OS X & Linux and Windows. We strongly recommend to install [Docker containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) 
or [Anaconda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) first. Requisites can be found in [requirements] (requirements.md) file.

See [Installing PICOSS](https://github.com/srsudo/picos_development/blob/master/info/installation.md) for detailed instructions about the installation of PICOSS. 

## Usage example

Once all dependencies are installed, we can run PICOSS from the terminal: 

```sh
$ python run_picos.py
```

The main interface should appear, and data can be accessed for posterior analysis. For detailed explanations and more 
examples about how to use PICOSS, please refer to the [tutorial](https://github.com/srsudo/picos_development/blob/master/info/tutorials/howto.md)_
